# C# Source Generators

This repository contains some code samples that I created through my experiments with [C# Source Generators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/source-generators-overview).

## Samples
### Hello Generated World
A simple generator for implement the static method *HelloGeneratedWorld* for entry point of the application using *partial* keyword aproach.
### CSV Headers To Class [In Progress]
Based on public data [source](https://dados.gov.br/dataset/mapa-do-turismo-brasileiro) of Brazilian Ministry of Tourism about brazilian tourism map as a sample, the generator is capable of generating a very simple class definition based on the headers of the CSV file as its properties.
